						I'm a professional problem solver and computers are how I solve problems.

						<h2>What are computers good at?</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							Computers are really dumb<br>
							Programmers have built up a huge library of reusable code

						<h3>A small set of instructions</h3>

						<aside class="notes">
							At their heart, computers can only do a small set of instructions<br>
							Intel processor understand somewhere around 2000 instructions<br>
							Instructions like:
							<ul>
								<li>Math operations like: ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE
								<li>STORE A VALUE IN MEMORY
								<li>ALGEBRAIC OPERATIONS
							</ul>

						<h3>Really really fast</h3>

						<aside class="notes">
							Modern computer can do more than 2 billion operations per second<br>
							For you to use Facebook, there are probably billions of lines of code in the site, the browser, OS, routers, servers, etc

					<h2>Two questions:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Should we solve this problem? ðŸ¤”</li>
						<li>Can we solve this problem? ðŸ’ª</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Ask these questions any time you're starting a new project: whether that project
						is as big as a new company or as small as a button on a website
						<ul>
							<li>Before starting a new project
							<li>Ask 2 questions
						</ul>

						<h2>Should we solve this problem? ðŸ¤”</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Getting back to our questions...First thing to ask is, "should we even do this project?"

						<h3>Is there a big enough market? ðŸ’°ðŸ’°</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							Will it generate money, save time for enough users, make things easier for people, etc<br>
							Example of Build using augmented reality to show what lights &amp; faucets look like in home

						<h3>Is this a "trivial" problem?</h3>
						<img src="./assets/photo-math-app.jpg" width="300px" alt="Screenshot from Photomath app from iTunes" />
						<aside class="notes">
							Maybe there are a lot of users that suffer from a problem but it's just not important to solve<br>
							Photomath solves math problems but maybe people should just learn to do math

						<h3>Has someone else already solved this?</h3>

						<aside class="notes">
							Unless we can do something better or cheaper, it often doesn't make sense
							to repeat work done by others.

						<h3>Now that we've decided that we should solve this problem...</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							The 2nd group of questions is....

						<h3>Computers are good at certain types of problems</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							We already talked about the limitations of computers:
							<ul>
								<li>small instruction set
								<li>really fast
							</ul>
							So when I thing about whether or not we can solve a problem, I think about
							the types of problems that computers are good at.

						<h3>Computationally Easy</h3>
						<img src="./assets/homerboardsimpsons1copy.jpg" width="600px" alt="Homer Simpson doing math at a chalkboard" />
						<aside class="notes">
							Computers are good at math but some calculations take longer than the lifespan of the universe<br>
							Sometimes you can estimate the solution<br>
							Encryption is an example of too slow. Mapping is an example of estimating

						<h3>Lots of Data</h3>
						<img src="./assets/netflix.jpeg" width="600px" alt="Netflix logo" style="border: 0" />
						<aside class="notes">
							Netflix is able to recommend movies because it has lots of data about what
							people like.  It also uses this data to design shows to be popular

						<h3>Don't understand the problem</h3>
						<img src="./assets/dont-understand.gif" width="80%" alt="Video from Scrubs TV show about not understanding a problem" style="border: 0" />

							You could over simplify the problem or miss it entirely. Your solution could cause unintended consequences<br>
