# Solving Problems with Computers
Garrett McCullough  
Senior Mobile Engineer @ Build.com  
I work on the e-commerce app for Build.com but, in reality, I'm a professional problem solver and computers are how I solve problems.

## What are computers good at?
- Computers are really dumb
- They'll do exactly what you tell them
- Programmers have built up a huge library of reusable code

### A small set of instructions
- At their heart, computers can only do a small set of instructions
- Intel processor understand somewhere around 2000 instructions
- Instructions like:
  - Math operations like: ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE
  - STORE A VALUE IN MEMORY
  - ALGEBRAIC OPERATIONS

### Really really fast
Modern computer can do more than 2 billion operations per second
For you to use Facebook, there are probably billions of lines of code in the site, the browser, OS, routers, servers, etc

## Two questions:
- Should we solve this problem? ðŸ¤”
- Can we solve this problem? ðŸ’ª

Ask these questions any time you're starting a new project: whether that project
is as big as a new company or as small as a button on a website

## Should we solve this problem? ðŸ¤”
First thing to ask is, "should we even do this project?"

### Is there a big enough market? ðŸ’°ðŸ’°
Will it generate money, save time for enough users, make things easier for people, etc  
Example of Build using augmented reality to show what lights &amp; faucets look like in home

### Is this a "trivial" problem?
Maybe there are a lot of users that suffer from a problem but it's just not important to solve  
Photomath solves math problems but maybe people should just learn to do math

### Is this the correct problem?
Users often come to us wanting one thing but needing another  
Anecdote about Clear Capital users wanting to copy/paste email text

### Has someone else already solved this?
Unless we can do something better or cheaper, it often doesn't make sense
to repeat work done by others.

### Now that we've decided that we should solve this problem...
The 2nd group of questions is....

## Can we solve this problem? ðŸ’ª
If a problem should be solved, does it need to be solved with computers?  
Problems with people are not good candidates  
Example, bullying at Facebook

### Computers are good at certain types of problems
We already talked about the limitations of computers:
- small instruction set
- really fast

So when I think about whether or not we can solve a problem, I think about
the types of problems that computers are good at.

### Well Defined or Understood
Things that have a set of repeatable steps are easy to automate or solve

### Computationally Easy
Computers are good at math but some calculations take longer than the lifespan of the universe.  These are computationally "hard" problems  
Sometimes you can estimate the solution  
Encryption is an example of too slow. Mapping is an example of estimating

### Lots of Data
	Netflix is able to recommend movies because it has lots of data about what
	people like.  It also uses this data to design shows to be popular

### So we're ready, right?
Now we've decided that we should solve this problem and we can solve this problem?  
So we're ready to get to work, right?

## Problems
Problems are bound to happen in a complex system  
It's helpful to try to think about what could go wrong first

### Don't understand the problem
You could over simplify the problem or your answer might be wrong entirely. Your solution could cause unintended consequences  
Airbus worked to make their planes quieter but the unintended consequence was that you can now hear every sound coming out of the bathroom

### Limited Data
You could be working with limited data either due to constraints or lack of planning.  
Google's first automated car couldn't get through an intersection because it wasn't trained on how real-world drivers behave

### Ethics
Automation can put people out of work, in some cases. What happens if no one works?

## Conclusion
- Think about what computers are good at
- Should we solve this problem? ðŸ¤”
- Can we solve this problem? ðŸ’ª
- Can we foresee any problems with our solution?
